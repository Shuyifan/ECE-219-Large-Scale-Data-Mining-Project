Large-Scale Data Mining: Models and Algorithms

Course description: (Formerly numbered Electrical Engineering 219.) Lecture, four hours; discussion, one hour; outside study, seven hours. Introduction of variety of scalable data modeling tools, both predictive and causal, from different disciplines. Topics include supervised and unsupervised data modeling tools from machine learning, such as support vector machines, different regression engines, different types of regularization and kernel techniques, deep learning, and Bayesian graphical models. Emphasis on techniques to evaluate relative performance of different methods and their applicability. Includes computer projects that explore entire data analysis and modeling cycle: collecting and cleaning large-scale data, deriving predictive and causal models, and evaluating performance of different models. Letter grading.
